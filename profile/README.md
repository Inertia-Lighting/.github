What is now known as Inertia Lighting; was once a small community known as C-Tech Lighting: established by Drawn & Alex, with 150 members in January of 2020.

Since then, Inertia has undergone many changes in management and has exceeded all community growth expectations.

Now led by Ross, Toto, and MidSpike, Inertia is working to provide quality Roblox stage lighting for developers.
