What is now known as Inertia Lighting; was once a small community known as C-Tech Lighting: established by Drawn & Alex, with 150 members in January of 2020.

Since then, Inertia has undergone changes in management and has exceeded all community growth expectations.

Now led by Drawn & Ross, Inertia is working towards providing quality Roblox stage lighting for developers.
